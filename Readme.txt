Dusting Robot Using Nice Kinematics (DRUNK)
Alex Gaal, Austin Tang, Chenyang Wang, and Haochen Yin

The MATLAB Code file includes forward and inverse kinematics, a small demo of simulation and workspace.
The Kinematics by Hand file is some hand written calcution work of the forward and inverse kinematics.
The CAD Model file is the CAD of the robot designed by CATIA. The main file is "DRUNK Robot.CATProduct", and also saved as "DRUNK Robot.STP". The other files are parts of the robot, there are so many parts so that may be difficult to view.
